- 👋 Hi, I was a software developer with 10 years of industry experience. Now, I am retired.
- 👀 I’m interested in languages (human or computer), build systems, and databases.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning with the hope to classify the names of my repos as a dataset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects.
- 📫 How to reach me:
    - Facebook handle 'bearddan2000'
    - Youtube channel 'BrokenKeys-r3d' 
- *Most repos use Docker with bash control script*
